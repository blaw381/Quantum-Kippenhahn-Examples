Quantisation of certain counterexamples to Kippenhahn's Conjecture

This directory contains two Mathematica notebook files which demonstrate the quantisation of two counterexamples to Kippenhahn's Conjecture. The first counterexample is due to Laffey (1983), and the second is due to Li, Spitkovsky, and Shukla (1998).
