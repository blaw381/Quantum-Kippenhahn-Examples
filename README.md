# Quantum-Kippenhahn-Examples
Quantisation of certain counterexamples to Kippenhahn's Conjecture

This repository contains two Mathematica notebook files which demonstrate the quantisation of two counterexamples to Kippenhahn's Conjecture. The first counterexample is due to Laffey (1983), and the second is due to Li, Spitkovsky, and Shukla (1998). Click the "download or clone" button to download the both files (plus this readme and the licence) as a single zip file. Due to changes with how GitHub works, this is currently the only way to download the nb files. Clicking on the files indivdually will lead to them being displayed in-browser without a download option.
